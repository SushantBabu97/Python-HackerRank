# Split and Join the String

"""
>>> a = "this is a string"
>>> a = a.split(" ") # a is converted to a list of strings. 
>>> print a
['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
Joining a string is simple:

>>> a = "-".join(a)
>>> print a
this-is-a-string 

You are given a string. Split the string on a " " (space) delimiter and join using a - hyphen.
