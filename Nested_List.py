Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Example:: 

records=[["chi",20.0],["beta",50.0],["alpha",50.0]]

The ordered list of scores is [20.0,50.0], so the second lowest score is 50.0. There are two students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:
["beta","alpha"]
alpha
beta
